Development Setup
=================

Here are instructions on how to get started on ExaCloud and setting up the
development environment needed to run the DADA2 workflow.

R Environment Setup
-------------------

There is a file `install-pkgs.R`, which contains code you can run to check the
correct version of R and install and/or check the necessary R packages to
install necessary to run the analysis.

Additionally, being on a cluster without root access, you'll want to specify
where to install your R packages, as you can't write to more upstream
directories. You can use the following to create a `.Renviron` file for R to
point to where you want to install R packages.

```bash
# Change paths according to your personal setup
mkdir -p ~/R/library
echo 'R_LIBS_USER="~/R/library"' > $HOME/.Renviron
```

Package Management
------------------

**Interactive Session**

To run an interactive session, run the following:

```bash
srun --pty /usr/bin/bash -l
```

This will allow you to test your code and workflow without worrying about
stressing out the head coordinating node.

**Setup**

Follow the instructions listed in [this document][exacloud] to setup a modern
development environment on the cluster. This isn't necessary if your
development environment is on a cluster where you have root access or you're
implementing this workflow locally.

Briefly, following the instructions linked above will give you the following:

- Miniconda, Python package and virtual environment management
- Linuxbrew, non-root package management on Linux systems

For this R workflow, you'll only really need to install Miniconda and R
essentials. The Anaconda environment has build [an `r-essential`
package][condar] with R and most used R packages for data science.

In sum,

```bash
# Open an interactive session
srun --pty bash -l

# Download and install Miniconda
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Say yes to adding Miniconda to .bash_profile

# Install R and relevant packages
conda install r-essentials

# For maintenance and update of all packages
conda update r-essentials

# For updating a single particular R package, replace XXXX
conda update r-XXXX
```

You'll need to sign out and sign back in of the cluster for the paths to be
reset so that R and other Conda installations will be used instead of the
system installations.

Slurm Workload Manager
----------------------

Slurm is the resource manager that I'll focus on for this workflow. Slurm
stands for "Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management."

Below are some useful commands to use within Slurm:

```bash
# Submit your script, first_script.sh
sbatch first_script.sh

# Look at jobs in the queue
squeue
```

You can use [this website][ceci] to help generate Slurm scripts. It is designed
for another cluster, but it should at least help with the initial drafting of a
submit script you'll want to use.
